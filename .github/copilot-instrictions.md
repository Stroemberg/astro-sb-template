### General Guidelines

- Write production-ready, type-safe code using TypeScript
- Follow existing naming conventions and file structure
- Ensure code is modular and reusable
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful variable/function names
- When being instructed that this is a proof of concept (PoC), do not add any css styling at all.
- use ? instead of adding undefined as a possible type.

## Review Philosophy

- Only comment when you have HIGH CONFIDENCE (>80%) that an issue exists
- Be concise: one sentence per comment when possible
- Focus on actionable feedback, not observations
- When reviewing text, only comment on clarity issues if the text is genuinely confusing or could lead to errors.
